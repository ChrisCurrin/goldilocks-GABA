# Goldilocks GABA: Network models incorporating chloride dynamics predict optimal strategies for terminating status epilepticus

## Abstract

> A seizure that continues for more than 5 minutes constitutes a medical emergency and is classified as status epilepticus (SE). The current first-line treatments for SE target the conductance of the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR). Recent experiment data has demonstrated that agents which positively modulate GABAARs can have a paradoxical effect that depends on the duration of the seizure and the GABA reversal potential (EGABA). As further clinical and experimental research is conducted to understand this life-threatening brain state, I have sought to complement research efforts with an in silico network model that recapitulates experimental results and informs future therapeutic strategies. I demonstrate that 1) elevated EGABA is sufficient to have a balanced network enter an SE-like activity state. 2) The network bursting activity responds to benzodiazepine-like GABAAR modulation in agreement with experiments. 3) Compromised Cl- extrusion can lead a stable network into SE and maintain SE after Cl- accumulation, which can arise via a seizure. 4) Specifically targeting Cl- extrusion in pyramidal cells showcases their primary role in maintaining a networkâ€™s SE state. 5) The total GABAergic current leading up to SE bursts correlates with the severity of the state. This model forms a foundation for further theoretical research into this pathology. Together, my results back up experimental findings and suggest future nuanced approaches to treatment.
